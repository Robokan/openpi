"""Adapter that exposes a FlashRT VLAModel as an openpi BasePolicy.

The openpi WebsocketPolicyServer was designed against the openpi
JAX/PyTorch ``Policy`` interface (``infer(obs: dict) -> dict``). To
keep robot clients unchanged when we swap the server-side inference to
FlashRT on DGX Spark, this adapter translates between the two formats.

Wire diagram::

    AsyncActionChunkBroker (client)
        │ obs dict (JPEG bytes / np arrays)
        ▼
    WebsocketPolicyServer
        │ obs dict, JPEG-decoded
        ▼
    FlashRTPolicyAdapter ──── FlashRT VLAModel.predict(images=[...], prompt=...)
        │
        ▼ {"actions": np.ndarray, "policy_timing": {...}}
    WebsocketPolicyServer.send
        │
        ▼
    AsyncActionChunkBroker (client)

What the adapter handles:
  - Image extraction from both openpi formats:
      a) Flat keys:      obs["observation/image"], obs["observation/wrist_image"]
      b) Nested "images": obs["images"]["cam_high"], obs["images"]["cam_wrist"]
      c) Flat keys (no observation/ prefix): obs["image"], obs["wrist_image"]
  - Channel-order normalization: openpi server may produce (C, H, W) from
    JPEG decode; FlashRT expects (H, W, C). Re-transpose as needed.
  - Resize to 224×224 (FlashRT's hardcoded pi05 input resolution).
  - Prompt extraction (with default_prompt fallback).
  - Timing instrumentation (matches openpi's policy_timing convention so
    the client's perf logs keep working).
  - Optional pass-through of RTC fields (currently a no-op for FlashRT,
    but preserved so the client doesn't get a None back).
